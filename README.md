Weight Tracking Android Application 

Problem: Create my own weight tracking application that my parents can use themselves on their android devices

Solution: To test my own java coding ability I wanted to create an application that would utilize a login / registration function.  The use of a sql database for recording weight data.  I wanted to work on a push notification system to keep the users engaged.

This is a minimal design since it is only used by my parents and myself.  I plan create a second version with more frills.
