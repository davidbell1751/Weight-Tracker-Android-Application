Weight Tracker
Author: David Bell

Version 1.0 

The goal of this applicaition is give the user the ability to track weight changes.  They can update their weight and set goals for them to reach.

Screens to assist the user with the applicaition are Login Screen / Weight Update Screen / Weight Database Screen

The initial Username and Password for this version is Admin   1234

The approach for coding this application was Research / Physical Drawings / UI Design in Android Studio / Java Coding for Functionality

I tested my database code to make sure that the user could CRUD / Create / Read / Update and Delete their database of information.  I also tested the login to make sure that only the correct username and password would grant access to the app.  The java math functions I created to give the user updates to their weight journey ran successfully as well.  The math took some time to accomoplish over a week I had to test the functions over and over until they all worked together.

I had to innovate with the database table.  I had to create a new screen with buttons that would give the user what they needed to CRUD their database.  This was the most challenging part of the applicaiton.

My skills in java programming were evidenced in my math functions to give the user weight change numbers.  This took some time but I like to practice my java programming as I believe this is the most important part of the app.


***** Database Entry Page *******
To enter a new sql database entry just fill in the top 3 entries with the corresponding information.  If you want to update an entry then you will use the ID field to select which database entry you want to update.  The ID field will not update the ID but it will select which ID you are choosing to update.
